## Econ 270 Homework 4

## Sampling Distributions

These questions are all pretty solid

Book Questions: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6

## Confidence Intervals

5.9 and 5.11 are good conceptual questions to check, 5.13 and 5.14 are good computational questions

5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 5.13 (b,c), 5.14 , 5.28

## Hypothesis Testing

5.22 is a good representative easy question. 5.25, 5.29, 5.30, and 5.35 are good conceptual questions

5.15, 5.16, 5.17 (you should immediately spot several catastrophic issues), 5.22 , 5.23 (this is moderately hard), 5.25, 5.29, 5.30, 5.35
