## Instructions

Please read the following before starting the exam:

1. The exam is worth 200 points and consists of 6 multiple choice questions and 2 free response questions. Point values are included next to questions - please allocate your time appropriately
2. There is a blank page on the back of the last sheet that you may use if you run out of room writing any questions - just label appropriately so that I can follow your work
3. You must show all your work to receive partial credit for incorrect answers.
4. You may not communicate with classmates or other people about the exam.
5. Laptops, phones, and other electronics devices are not allowed during the exam. You may use a calculator.

y <- dnorm(x,-2,1)
dt <- data.table(x=x,p=y)
plot1 <- ggplot(data=dt,aes(x=x,y=p)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-5,5)) + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1.2)) +ggtitle("A")
y <- dnorm(x,2,1)
dt <- data.table(x=x,p=y)

  names(dt) <- c("x","y")
  dt
}
plot1 <- ggplot(data=f(0),aes(x=x,y=y)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-2,2)) + ggtitle("A")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2,plot3,plot4,ncol=2)
```
